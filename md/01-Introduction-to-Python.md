## 1. Introduction to Python

### Overview of Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Key features include:

- **Easy to learn**: Clear syntax and readability
- **Versatile**: Used in web development, data science, AI, and more
- **Large community**: Extensive libraries and frameworks
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on various operating systems

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Install Python**:
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Choose the latest stable version (e.g., Python 3.9)
   - Follow installation instructions for your OS

2. **Verify Installation**:
   Open a terminal/command prompt and type:
   
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
   
3. **Install an IDE** (Optional):
- Popular choices: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook
- Each offers different features for development

### Writing Your First Python Program

1. Open a text editor or IDE
2. Type the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

3. Save the file as hello.py
4. Run the program:
- In terminal: python hello.py
- In IDE: Use the run button

### Basic Syntax
- Indentation: Python uses indentation to define code blocks
- Comments: Use # for single-line comments, ''' or """ for multi-line
- Variables: No declaration needed, dynamically typed

```python
# This is a comment
"""
This is a multi-line
comment
"""
name = "Alice"  # String variable
age = 30        # Integer variable
print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")
```

### Exercise

1. Create a program that asks for the user's name and greets them.
2. Use the input() function to get user input.

### Next Steps

- Experiment with different print statements
- Try basic mathematical operations in Python
- Explore the Python interactive shell by typing python in the terminal
